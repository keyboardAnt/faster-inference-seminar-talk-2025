## Requirements

1. Install `marp-cli` (for example, on macOS, you can use Homebrew: `brew install marp-cli`)

## Usage
1. Run `make html` to generate the slides in `talk.html`. Marp will automatically watch the `talk.md` file and update the slides in real-time.
2. Open `talk.html` in your browser to view the slides.

To generate the slides in `talk.pdf`, run `make pdf`.
